# What's New

Check back regularly to see what's new with IBM Cloud Direct Link. We're growing daily!

## June 2018

### IBM Cloud Direct Link Service Provider Program

We're pleased to announce our new IBM Cloud Direct Link Service Provider Program, which enables enterprises to select from a robust ecosystem of local and global providers and create the private connections to IBM Cloud that best suit their needs. We'll work closely to provide technical enablement and training to help ensure service providers can offer enterprises reliable connectivity to the cloud from anywhere in the world. This gives our joint customers greater choice to select the right provider, speed of service, location and deployment model to create a secure, highly available hybrid connection.
