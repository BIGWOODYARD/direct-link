## How to order when there is no VRF present

For the accounts with no VRF present, the **Select VRF** field is not displayed in the order form. After placing an order in this case, an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} support ticket is generated. The ticket number and details are shown in the UI screen after you place the order.
