# How to order IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange

1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate PoP and cross-connect into the associated Exchange provider.
2. Use the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) to open an IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange request and complete the requested information. (Assistance from IBM sales engineers can be requested.) If you use the Equinix provider, you can use [automated ordering](cloud-exchange-automation.html).
3. Contact your Exchange provider and negotiate connectivity to your exchange.
4. Order connectivity between your network provider and the Exchange provider.
5. Order a "virtual circuit" through the Exchange provider, and refer the Ticket ID of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} Direct Link request as your "Request ID" or "Authorization ID"
6. IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} networking infrastructure will be completed within 3 business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.
