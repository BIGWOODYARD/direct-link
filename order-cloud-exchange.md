# How to order Direct Link Cloud Exchange

1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate PoP and cross-connect into the associated Cloud Exchange provider.
2. Use the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) to open a Direct Link Cloud Exchange request and complete the requested information. (Assistance from IBM sales engineers can be requested.) If you use the Equinix provider, you have the option to use [automated ordering](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/direct-link-cloud-exchange/cloud-exchange-automation.html#order-cloud-exchange-using-automation-limited-release-for-equinix-users-).
3. Contact the Cloud Exchange provider and negotiate connectivity to your exchange.
4. Order connectivity between your network provider and the Cloud Exchange provider.
5. Order a "virtual circuit" through the Cloud Exchange provider, and refer the Ticket ID of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} Direct Link request as your "Request ID" or "Authorization ID"
6. IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} networking infrastructure will be completed within 3 business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.
