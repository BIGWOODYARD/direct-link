# How to order Direct Link NSP

1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate PoP and cross-connect into the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} environment.
2. Open a Direct Link NSP request and complete the requested information. (Assistance from IBM sales engineers can be requested.)
3. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} provides the Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the connection.
4. Confirm that your circuit has reached the PoP and has been completed by the carrier.
5. Order the cross-connect using the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} CFA (Customer Facility Assignment) information in the LOA, which usually takes between 2 and 10 business days to complete. (This timeframe depends upon the facilty vendor and the type of order priority as it is placed by the customer.) This process includes setting up the patch to the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} termination port.
6. Provide {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} with the cross-connect completion notice from the facility provider in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} portal ticket.
7. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} will verify the completion notice's efficacy and order the patch to be made from the LOA/CFA to the cross-connect router (XCR) and other gear.
8. Your IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} networking infrastructure will be completed within 3 business days after the cross-connect is complete.
