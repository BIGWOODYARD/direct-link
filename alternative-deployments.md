# Alternatives for your IBM Cloud Direct Link Deployment

This document illustrates some alternatives that our customers sometimes choose as use cases for their IBM Cloud Direct Link deployments.

## Diverse deployments for Exchange and Connect

The default deployments of Direct Link Connect and Direct Link Exchange do not include redundant configuration, although they can be deployed diversely on discrete routers.

Many of our customers choose to create redundant deployments by setting up an additional Direct Link connection. This document presents some schematic representations of alternate IBM Cloud Direct Link deployments.
