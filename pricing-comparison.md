# Competitive pricing overview
{: #competitive-pricing-overview}

Enterprises choose to use private cloud interconnection such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link for many reasons, including superior network performance, security and privacy requirements, and reduction of bandwidth costs. Although your company may adopt a private cloud interconnection network architecture because of the performance and security advantages, the associated reduction of network costs is a metric that clearly favors IBM Cloud Direct Link in many usage scenarios. 

## Why choose IBM Direct Link?
{: #why-choose-ibm-cloud-direct-link}

IBM’s standard rates for Direct Link reflect a significant value for customers that use cloud resources on an active basis. This fact is borne out in calculating TCO for a Direct Link against its competition.

A 10Gbps Dedicated Direct Link connection currently is priced at $4,999 in North America. This offering grants unlimited ingress and egress to IBM Cloud resources across the connection. Direct Link does not have a metered option.

The following comparisons reflect the tipping point against hypothetical examples. The table at the end of this article shows a detailed summary of this price comparison, by geographic region.

## Company A
{: #Company A}

Company “A” offers a metered offering that lends itself to cheap Ingress but significant variable pricing on Egress.
* The Company “A” 10Gbps pricing is comprised of port hours at a $1,620 monthly recurring charge (MRC) plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America).
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, a Company “A” Direct Link equivalent  10Gbps connection at 5% usage (or 170TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $5,020, versus $4,999 for a Direct Link 10Gbps connection. Any data egress above 5% (or 170TB) in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat rate pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming an Company “A” customer has 50% usage (or 1.7PB) egressed in a month, it would cost $35,620, versus the $4,999 price for a 10Gbps Direct Link connection.

## Company G
{: #Company G}

Company G offers a metered offering that lends itself to cheap Ingress but significant variable pricing on Egress.

* The Company G 10Gbps pricing is set at $1,750 MRC plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America).
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, a Company “G” Direct Link equivalent  10Gbps port at 5% usage,  (170TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $5,172 versus $4,999 for Direct Link 10Gbps connection. 
* Any data egress above 5% (or 170TB) in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat rate pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming a Company “G” customer has 50% usage (or 1.7 PB) egressed in a month, it would cost $35,772, versus the $4,999 price for a 10Gbps Direct Link connection.

## Company M
{: #Company M}

Company "M" (like Company "A" and Company "G") presents a metered offering that lends itself to inexpensive ingress but significantly variable pricing on egress. Company "M" also offers an unlimited pricing table. Both options are compared in the next sections.

### Metered
{: #metered}

* The Company "M" 10Gbps pricing consists of a port fee ($5,000 MRC) plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America). Right from the start, ANY data transferred out will be more expensive than IBM Cloud Direct Link!!!
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, a Company “M” Direct Link equivalent  10Gbps port at 5% usage (or 170TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $8,400, versus $4,999 for a Direct Link 10Gbps connection. 
* Any data egress above 1TB in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming a Company “M”  customer has 50% usage (or 1.7 PB) egressed in a month, it would cost $47,500, versus the $4,999 price for a 10Gbps Direct Link connection.


### Unmetered 
{: #unmetered}

* The Company “M” Direct Link equivalent  10Gbps pricing consists of a port fee of $51,000 MRC for unlimited ingress and egress.

* For an apples-to-apples perspective to IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated, this monthly cost amounts to $51,000, versus $4,999 for a 10Gbps Direct Link connection.
