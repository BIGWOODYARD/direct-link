## Pricing for IBM Cloud Dedicated Hosting

IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated Hosting requests and pricing will be handled on a transactional basis to account for regional differences in vendor availability and pricing.

The IBM Cloud Dedicated Hosting minimum configuration includes one (1) rack with 5Kw of power and two (2) ports at chosen speed. Additional co-location add-ons are available.

## Local routing

Local routing is included as a basic part of all IBM Cloud Direct Link offerings. It includes access to all of the datacenters connected directly to the PoP location, and it provides unlimited ingress and egress traffic. If you need to route your traffic outside the PoP location in the area within which you are ordering Direct Link, you must add the Global Routing option. Otherwise, your traffic is restricted to the services provided by the local PoP.

## Pricing for Global Routing Add-on

Global routing expands access to include all IBM Cloud datacenters globally. Bandwidth is metered and charged monthly based on the market. Details on the markets and other considerations can be found in our [FAQs file](faqs.html#what-are-the-local-routing-and-global-routing-options)

If you select Global Routing, you are not charged for any local egress traffic, only for traffic that originates or terminates outside of the local PoP.
